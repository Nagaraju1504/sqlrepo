11. What is normalization?

Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy and dependency by organizing 
fields and table of a database. The main aim of Normalization is to add, delete or modify
 field that can be made in a single table.

12. What is Denormalization?

DeNormalization is a technique used to access the data from higher to lower normal forms of database.
 It is also process of introducing redundancy into a table by incorporating data from the related tables.
13. What are all the different normalizations?

The normal forms can be divided into 5 forms, and they are explained below -.

• First Normal Form (1NF):.

This should remove all the duplicate columns from the table. Creation of tables for the related data and identification of unique columns.

• Second Normal Form (2NF):.

Meeting all requirements of the first normal form. Placing the subsets of data in separate tables and Creation of relationships between the tables using primary keys.
• Third Normal Form (3NF):.

This should meet all requirements of 2NF. Removing the columns which are not dependent on primary key constraints.

• Fourth Normal Form (4NF):.

Meeting all the requirements of third normal form and it should not have multi-valued dependencies.

14. What is a View?

A view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. Views are not virtually present, and it takes less space to store. View can have data of one or more tables combined, and it is depending on the relationship.
