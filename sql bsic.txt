4. What is a Database?

Database is nothing but an organized form of data for easy access, storing, 
retrieval and managing of data. This is also known as structured form of data which 
can be accessed in many ways.

3. What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is used to communicate with the
 Database. This is a standard language used to perform tasks such as retrieval, 
updation, insertion and deletion of data from a database.
----------------------------------
6.What is a primary key?
A primary key is a combination of fields which uniquely specify a row. 
This is a special kind of unique key, and it has implicit NOT NULL constraint. 
It means, Primary key values cannot be NULL.
---------------------------------
7. What is a unique key?
A Unique key constraint uniquely identified each record in the database. 
This provides uniqueness for the column or set of columns.
Primary key constraint has automatic unique constraint defined on it. But not,
 in the case of Unique Key.
---------------------------
8. What is a foreign key?
A foreign key is one table which can be related to the primary key of another table.
 Relationship needs to be created between two tables by referencing foreign key with 
the primary key of another table.
----------------------------
9. What is a join?
This is a keyword used to query data from more tables based on the relationship 
between the fields of the tables. Keys play a major role when JOINS are used.

----------------------------------
10. What are the types of join and explain each?

There are various types of join which can be used to retrieve data and it depends on 
the
 relationship between tables.

â€¢ Inner Join.
-select columns from table1 inner join table2 on table1.columns = table2.coulmns

Right Join.
select columns from table1 right join table2 on table1.columns = table2.coulmns

Left Join.
select columns from table1 left join table2 on table1.columns = table2.coulmns

Full Join.
select columns from table1 full join table2 on table1.columns = table2.coulmns

20. What is subquery?

A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query,
 and inner query is called subquery. SubQuery is always executed first, and the result 
of subquery is passed on to the main query.

21. What are the types of subquery?

There are two types of subquery Correlated and Non-Correlated.

A correlated subquery cannot be considered as independent query.
15. What is an Index?

An index is performance tuning method of allowing faster retrieval of records from 
the table. An index creates an entry for each value and it will be faster to retrieve 
data.
